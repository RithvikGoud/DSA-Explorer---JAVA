# DSA-Explorer---JAVA

## Project Overview
**DSA Explorer** is a Java program designed to help users explore various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The program serves as a guide, offering both theoretical explanations and practical implementations of common algorithms, including sorting, searching, and graph algorithms.

## Features
- Interactive menu for selecting different DSA topics
- Practical experience with algorithms such as sorting, searching, and graph traversal
- User input prompts to test the selected algorithms
- Performance analysis of each algorithm, including time complexity (and optionally, space complexity)
- Option to repeat exploration or exit the program

## Project Stages

### Stage I: DSA Method Selection
When the program starts, it will prompt the user with:

  The available options are:
  - **Sorting**
  - **Searching**
  - **Graph Algorithms**

### Stage II: Subtopics Exploration
If the user selects one of the options, the program will show relevant subtopics to explore.

- **For Sorting**: The program will present the following sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - (Any two additional sorting algorithms you choose)

- **For Searching**: The program will present five searching algorithms to explore.

- **For Graph Algorithms**: The program will present:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)

### Stage III: User Interaction
After selecting a specific algorithm, the user will be prompted to input:
- **For Sorting/Searching Algorithms**: 10 numbers/texts
- **For Searching Algorithms**: A target value to search for

### Stage IV: Algorithm Execution
Based on the user's selection, the program will execute the chosen algorithm on the provided input.

### Stage V: Results Display
Once the algorithm is executed:
- **For Sorting**: Display the sorted list.
- **For Searching**: Display the result of the search (whether the target value is found or not).
- Include an analysis of the algorithmâ€™s performance, such as:
  - Time complexity
  - Optional: Space complexity

### Stage VI: Repeat or Exit
After displaying the results, the program will ask the user if they would like to:
- Explore another algorithm
- Exit the program

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Explorer.git
   ```
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac main.java  # or use the actual file name of your program
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java main  # Replace 'DSAExplorer' with your actual Java class name
   ```
